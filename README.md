Lua Updates CRC Automatically

Author: [f-ve](https://github.com/f-ve)

About
===
The project, luca is an idea I had to use Cheat Engine's Lua Scripting API to update CRC Information Automatically. Currently it is focused on Themida.

Goal
===
To first, gather crc addresses. Then test each address's crc run once to make sure it works properly. This is not a crc bypass, only an address obtainer and tester. However, luca could easily be converted into one.
