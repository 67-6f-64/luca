Lua Updates CRC Automatically

Author: [f-ve](https://github.com/f-ve)

About
===
The project, luca is an idea I had to use Cheat Engine's Lua Scripting API to update CRC Information Automatically. Currently it is focused on Themida.

Goal
===
Main objective is to gather process information. For a crc to work properly we would need the base address, size, and end point. Once those are added, then gather crc addresses, and finally test each address's crc run once to make sure it works properly. This is not a crc bypass, only an address obtainer and tester. However, luca could easily be converted into one.
